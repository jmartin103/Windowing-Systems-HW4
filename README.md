# Windowing-Systems-HW4
A graphical user interface containing two combo boxes, two buttons, a tab manager, and a stack panel. The left combo box is used to select between the stack panel and the tab manager, while the right combo box is used to switch between a message box and a save file dialog. If the button underneath the left combo box is clicked, and the tab manager is selected, a new tab is added to the manager; otherwise, if the stack panel is chosen, a new label is added to the stack panel. If the button underneath the right combo box is clicked, and the message box option is selected, a dialog box is displayed; otherwise, if the file dialog is selected, the full path of the file is printed to the console.
